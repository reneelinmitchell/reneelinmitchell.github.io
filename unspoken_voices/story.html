	<p>To understand how I came to the US, you must first know a little bit about my background. I am from Guatemala, a developing country but I have to confess I form part of the upper class. I am so what embarrased to say it, but I am from the Guatemalan "elite" and I am not saying this to brag but it is very important to the context of my story.</p>

<p>In Guatemala there are only two international schools and I attended one of them. This was not the usual; every Guatemalan was supposed to attend a local school and form friendships and connections with other Guatemalan kids. That's how it always has been and no one breaks the tradition. However, my parents sent me to a school where the diplomats' kids attended and where children from managers of multinational corporations went to. I went to an international American school.</p>

<p>Since I was exposed to that American-international culture at a very young age, to me the norm was moving around from seeing my friends hop from one country to another. Because the majority of students were American, the majority went to study abroad. So I grew up thinking studying abroad was the norm and since I was young I knew I was going to study abroad. In high school I never considered staying in Guatemala. I had grown so apart from the Guatemalans that I did not have connections or bonds, so there was nothing making me want to stay and culturally, I had adapted to many American behaviors, that I did not completely fit in to the Guatemalan lifestyle.</p>

<p>During junior year I learned how colleges in the US and other country offer a variety of degrees, to the extent that some universities have different career-focused schools, such as business, engineering, art, music, politics schools within one university. In Guatemala, you enter college studying for a specific major since your first year, take a specified set of classes, and can only major in one subject. There is no variety. For example the few universities that offer some business degrees, only offer Business Administration. On the contrary, UVA offers finance, banking, accounting, global commerce, in the business school. I came to the US because I liked the freedom of being able to change my mind. If I decided that I didn't want to do commerce, I could take different classes next semester and change my major without getting behind. In Guatemala, if you don't pass a class or decide to change majors, you get behind one entire year.</p>

<p>So during senior year, I applied to colleges. That was my "normal." I saw many generations, my friends' brothers, my friends, and everyone in my school apply during the fall and get acceptance letters during the spring term. Every single senior in my class did extensive research on international universities. NOT ONE SINGLE PERSON, looked at universities in Guatemala. Everyone grew up with the mentality to study in the US, maybe in the UK, because the American system was so en-rooted in us. My school shaped me culturally. I celebrated Thanksgiving, Halloween, learned about Black History Month, was paying extremely close attention to the elections, was aware of all the social injustices in the US. Took APs and MUN; in PE we took the physical tests such as the beep test, mile run, and hang test that are set by the US government. At the end of the year, I would receive the President's Academic Award (from the American president). None of these were Guatemalan traditions, I grew up with an American background, with Guatemalan traditions and values. Although I was in Guatemala, I grew up with the American dream.</p>

<p>But my normal is not normal. Guatemalans don't study in the US. They don't know how to even start looking for them or what to type on the search engine, like "top business undergrad schools." They don't know about the CommonApp, about SATs. Guatemalans cannot afford paying for school, nor do they have the money to apply for a student's visa. So don't take my experience to stereotype Latin Americans because I do not represent my country completely. I had an easy time coming here, but that's not the case.</p>

<p>I came to the US because it offered me the best school I could get into. It was the best the could fit my wants and needs as best as possible. My parents were hesitant on letting me come. Although they knew Guatemala could not offer me all the opportunities offered here and that I would be limited to grow, they thought I would lose myself. That has not been the case.</p>

<p>I did not feel a change from transitioning from high school to college. Honestly, the biggest change has been having to do my laundry and do my bed. I had grown up with Americans my entire life, and with kids who were Hispanic-American, Asian-American, that when I meet other minorities, I already feel like I know their stories and backgrounds. I've had an easy time fitting in. I'm surprised because I feel like I have adapted faster and better than many American students. I think it has been because many of the people I met came from all over the world and were so cultured and educated that I know about so many cultures and events and ways of thinking. I have been exposed to so much, I haven't been limited to just a county or a state, so I know about all American social issues. I can empathize so easily with anyone because I have grown up with people from many ethnicities, economic backgrounds, religious and political beliefs, so it is not a shock.</p>

<p>I do admit that UVA is a very elite school. The stereotype of "girls with pearls and guys in ties" does apply, it is very preppy. This is were being part of the elite plays an important role in my life. My friendships and surroundings were very elite, much like UVA or to an extent even higher. The kids in my school came from diplomatic families, from parents who were engineers and business leaders and ran the country's multinationals. I was prepared to encounter every kind of preppy kid here so I wasn't surprised. I fit better at UVA than I would do in Guatemala because here I am not criticized for dressing up or taking care of myself. In Guatemala people put too much emphasis on what one wears and how one acts, but here, because people are so used to dressing a certain way and owning certain brands, no one criticizes, and that freedom of being able to dress up as much as you want or going out in pjs, is what I like.</p>

<p>The one thing I miss from home is the "physical contact" and closeness that people have. Americans are said to be cold and to a certain extent they are. Back at home I kiss everyone when saying hi, even if they're strangers, lean in for hugs, stop people in the middle of the street for hour-long conversations, arrive at houses without confirming first. Here, greetings are handshakes or an impersonal wave. Hispanic form of affections is seen as too forward or aggressive here and I've had a hard time balancing keeping distance and being impersonal when I grew up with so much "public" displace of affections. In Guatemala we don't hide our feelings, we tell everyone we love them but here one does not love everyone.</p>

<p>Finally, the big shocker has been the work culture. It seems like it is encouraged for students to be stressed and overwhelmed and project those feelings. People will rarely tell you "I'm great! Relaxing, loving and enjoying this. I am free." If you are, you are probably doing something wrong apparently. America has an ethic of working non-stop to the point that they dehumanize themselves. They value work more than relationships, or health, or life, almost. In Guatemala, work is not brought into the home. People take breaks and pauses. In Guatemala, the weekend is to relax, and rest. There is a separation between work and home. Here, the line is blurred. It's ironic because although we are the developing country and live in poverty, we know when to stop working. Americans, who have are richer, just work. Although we are poorer, I feel like we enjoy life more. We appreciate more and are more thankful. Americans are so focused in their work that they haven't realized that the value they are producing does not compensate them killing themselves. Before coming here, I had never seen so many people with anxiety, depression, eating disorders. Those were things that only adults would get with time and it would be due to hard situations like their spouse dying, but not young adults. Mental health problems don't exist in kids my age in Guatemala. The times I saw girls crying in my hall were countless, that is not okay. I came to the US looking for the American dream, but the American dream has put too much pressure on people that it has led them to the border of collapse and it has made me rethink my goals.</p>
